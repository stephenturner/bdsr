    "text": "Preface\nThis book was written as a companion to a series of courses introducing the essentials of biological data science with R. While this book was written with the accompanying live instruction in mind, this book can be used as a self-contained self study guide for quickly learning the essentials need to get started with R. The BDSR book and accompanying course introduces methods, tools, and software for reproducibly managing, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing large-scale biological data using the R statistical computing environment. This book also covers essential statistical analysis, and advanced topics including survival analysis, predictive modeling, forecasting, and text mining.\nThis is not a “Tool X” or “Software Y” book. I want you to take away from this book and accompanying course the ability to use an extremely powerful scientific computing environment (R) to do many of the things that you’ll do across study designs and disciplines – managing, manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing large, sometimes high-dimensional data. Regardless of your specific discipline you’ll need the same computational know-how and data literacy to do the same kinds of basic tasks in each. This book might show you how to use specific tools here and there (e.g., DESeq2 for RNA-seq analysis (Love, Huber, and Anders 2014), ggtree for drawing phylogenetic trees (Yu et al. 2017), etc.), but these are not important – you probably won’t be using the same specific software or methods 10 years from now, but you’ll still use the same underlying data and computational foundation. That is the point of this series – to arm you with a basic foundation, and more importantly, to enable you to figure out how to use this tool or that tool on your own, when you need to.\nThis is not a statistics book. There is a short lesson on essential statistics using R in Chapter 7 but this short chapter offers neither a comprehensive background on underlying theory nor in-depth coverage of implementation strategies using R. Some general knowledge of statistics and study design is helpful, but isn’t required for going through this book or taking the accompanying course.\nThere are no prerequisites to this book or the accompanying course. However, each chapter involves lots of hands-on practice coding, and you’ll need to download and install required softwar and download required data. See the setup instructions in Appendix A.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis book is partially adapted from material we developed for the University of Virginia BIMS8382 graduate course .

    "text": "1.1 RStudio\nLet’s start by learning about RStudio. R is the underlying statistical computing environment. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier.\n\nOptions: First, let’s change a few options. We’ll only have to do this once. Under Tools… Global Options…:\n\nUnder General: Uncheck “Restore most recently opened project at startup”\nUnder General: Uncheck “Restore .RData into workspace at startup”\nUnder General: Set “Save workspace to .RData on exit:” to Never.\nUnder General: Set “Save workspace to .RData on exit:” to Never.\nUnder R Markdown: Uncheck “Show output inline for all R Markdown documents”\n\nProjects: first, start a new project in a new folder somewhere easy to remember. When we start reading in data it’ll be important that the code and the data are in the same place. Creating a project creates an Rproj file that opens R running in that folder. This way, when you want to read in dataset whatever.txt, you just tell it the filename rather than a full path. This is critical for reproducibility, and we’ll talk about that more later.\nCode that you type into the console is code that R executes. From here forward we will use the editor window to write a script that we can save to a file and run it again whenever we want to. We usually give it a .R extension, but it’s just a plain text file. If you want to send commands from your editor to the console, use CMD+Enter (Ctrl+Enter on Windows).\nAnything after a # sign is a comment. Use them liberally to comment your code."

    "text": "1.2 Basic operations\nR can be used as a glorified calculator. Try typing this in directly into the console. Make sure you’re typing into into the editor, not the console, and save your script. Use the run button, or press CMD+Enter (Ctrl+Enter on Windows).\n\n2+2\n\n[1] 4\n\n5*4\n\n[1] 20\n\n2^3\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nR Knows order of operations and scientific notation.\n\n2+3*4/(5+3)*15/2^2+3*4^2\n\n[1] 55.6\n\n5e4\n\n[1] 50000\n\n\nHowever, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign values to objects. To create objects, we need to give it a name followed by the assignment operator &lt;- and the value we want to give it:\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 55\n\n&lt;- is the assignment operator. Assigns values on the right to objects on the left, it is like an arrow that points from the value to the object. Mostly similar to = but not always. Learn to use &lt;- as it is good programming practice. Using = in place of &lt;- can lead to issues down the line. The keyboard shortcut for inserting the &lt;- operator is Alt-dash.\nObjects can be given any name such as x, current_temperature, or subject_id. You want your object names to be explicit and not too long. They cannot start with a number (2x is not valid but x2 is). R is case sensitive (e.g., weight_kg is different from Weight_kg). There are some names that cannot be used because they represent the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., if, else, for, see here for a complete list). In general, even if it’s allowed, it’s best to not use other function names, which we’ll get into shortly (e.g., c, T, mean, data, df, weights). In doubt check the help to see if the name is already in use. It’s also best to avoid dots (.) within a variable name as in my.dataset. It is also recommended to use nouns for variable names, and verbs for function names.\nWhen assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force to print the value by typing the name:\n\nweight_kg\n\n[1] 55\n\n\nNow that R has weight_kg in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For instance, we may want to convert this weight in pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg).\n\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 121\n\n\nWe can also change a variable’s value by assigning it a new one:\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 57.5\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 127\n\n\nThis means that assigning a value to one variable does not change the values of other variables. For example, let’s store the animal’s weight in pounds in a variable.\n\nweight_lb &lt;- 2.2 * weight_kg\n\nand then change weight_kg to 100.\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 100\n\nWhat do you think is the current content of the object weight_lb? 126.5 or 220?\nYou can see what objects (variables) are stored by viewing the Environment tab in Rstudio. You can also use the ls() function. You can remove objects (variables) with the rm() function. You can do this one at a time or remove several objects at once. You can also use the little broom button in your environment pane to remove everything from your environment.\n\nls()\nrm(weight_lb, weight_kg)\nls()\nweight_lb # oops! you should get an error because weight_lb no longer exists!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nWhat are the values after each statement in the following?\n\nmass &lt;- 50              # mass?\nage  &lt;- 30              # age?\nmass &lt;- mass * 2        # mass?\nage  &lt;- age - 10        # age?\nmass_index &lt;- mass/age  # massIndex?"

If you take any kind of longer introduction to R you’ll probably learn about arrays, lists, matrices, etc. We are going to skip straight to the data structure you’ll probably use most – the tibble (also known as the data frame). We use tibbles to store heterogeneous tabular data in R: tabular, meaning that individuals or observations are typically represented in rows, while variables or features are represented as columns; heterogeneous, meaning that columns/features/variables can be different classes (on variable, e.g. age, can be numeric, while another, e.g., cause of death, can be text).\nWe’ll learn more about tibbles in Chapter 2."

This data is from a gene expression microarray, and in this paper the authors are examining the relationship between growth rate and gene expression in yeast cultures limited by one of six different nutrients (glucose, leucine, ammonium, sulfate, phosphate, uracil). If you give yeast a rich media loaded with nutrients except restrict the supply of a single nutrient, you can control the growth rate to any rate you choose. By starving yeast of specific nutrients you can find genes that:\n\nRaise or lower their expression in response to growth rate. Growth-rate dependent expression patterns can tell us a lot about cell cycle control, and how the cell responds to stress. The authors found that expression of &gt;25% of all yeast genes is linearly correlated with growth rate, independent of the limiting nutrient. They also found that the subset of negatively growth-correlated genes is enriched for peroxisomal functions, and positively correlated genes mainly encode ribosomal functions.\nRespond differently when different nutrients are being limited. If you see particular genes that respond very differently when a nutrient is sharply restricted, these genes might be involved in the transport or metabolism of that specific nutrient.\n\nYou can download the cleaned up version of the data here. The file is called brauer2007_tidy.csv. Later on we’ll actually start with the original raw data (minimally processed) and manipulate it so that we can make it more amenable for analysis."

    "section": "2.2 Reading in data",
    "text": "2.2 Reading in data\n\n2.2.1 dplyr and readr\nThere are some built-in functions for reading in data in text files. These functions are read-dot-something – for example, read.csv() reads in comma-delimited text data; read.delim() reads in tab-delimited text, etc. We’re going to read in data a little bit differently here using the readr package. When you load the readr package, you’ll have access to very similar looking functions, named read-underscore-something – e.g., read_csv(). You have to have the readr package installed to access these functions. Compared to the base functions, they’re much faster, they’re good at guessing the types of data in the columns, they don’t do some of the other silly things that the base functions do. We’re going to use another package later on called dplyr, and if you have the dplyr package loaded as well, and you read in the data with readr, the data will display nicely.\nFirst let’s load those packages.\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nIf you see a warning that looks like this: Error in library(packageName) : there is no package called 'packageName', then you don’t have the package installed correctly. See the setup chapter (Appendix A).\n\n\n2.2.2 read_csv()\nNow, let’s actually load the data. You can get help for the import function with ?read_csv. When we load data we assign it to a variable just like any other, and we can choose a name for that data. Since we’re going to be referring to this data a lot, let’s give it a short easy name to type. I’m going to call it ydat. Once we’ve loaded it we can type the name of the object itself (ydat) to see it printed to the screen.\n\nydat &lt;- read_csv(file=\"data/brauer2007_tidy.csv\")\nydat\n\n# A tibble: 198,430 × 7\n   symbol systematic_name nutrient  rate expression bp                     mf   \n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 SFB2   YNL049C         Glucose   0.05      -0.24 ER to Golgi transport  mole…\n 2 &lt;NA&gt;   YNL095C         Glucose   0.05       0.28 biological process un… mole…\n 3 QRI7   YDL104C         Glucose   0.05      -0.02 proteolysis and pepti… meta…\n 4 CFT2   YLR115W         Glucose   0.05      -0.33 mRNA polyadenylylatio… RNA …\n 5 SSO2   YMR183C         Glucose   0.05       0.05 vesicle fusion*        t-SN…\n 6 PSP2   YML017W         Glucose   0.05      -0.69 biological process un… mole…\n 7 RIB2   YOL066C         Glucose   0.05      -0.55 riboflavin biosynthes… pseu…\n 8 VMA13  YPR036W         Glucose   0.05      -0.75 vacuolar acidification hydr…\n 9 EDC3   YEL015W         Glucose   0.05      -0.24 deadenylylation-indep… mole…\n10 VPS5   YOR069W         Glucose   0.05      -0.16 protein retention in … prot…\n# ℹ 198,420 more rows\n\n\nTake a look at that output. The nice thing about loading dplyr and reading in data with readr is that data frames are displayed in a much more friendly way. This dataset has nearly 200,000 rows and 7 columns. When you import data this way and try to display the object in the console, instead of trying to display all 200,000 rows, you’ll only see about 10 by default. Also, if you have so many columns that the data would wrap off the edge of your screen, those columns will not be displayed, but you’ll see at the bottom of the output which, if any, columns were hidden from view. If you want to see the whole dataset, there are two ways to do this. First, you can click on the name of the data.frame in the Environment panel in RStudio. Or you could use the View() function (with a capital V).\n\nView(ydat)"

Passing a data frame to the summary() function prints out useful summary statistics about numeric column (min, max, median, mean, etc.)\n\n\n\nhead(ydat)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  symbol systematic_name nutrient  rate expression bp                      mf   \n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;chr&gt;\n1 SFB2   YNL049C         Glucose   0.05      -0.24 ER to Golgi transport   mole…\n2 &lt;NA&gt;   YNL095C         Glucose   0.05       0.28 biological process unk… mole…\n3 QRI7   YDL104C         Glucose   0.05      -0.02 proteolysis and peptid… meta…\n4 CFT2   YLR115W         Glucose   0.05      -0.33 mRNA polyadenylylation* RNA …\n5 SSO2   YMR183C         Glucose   0.05       0.05 vesicle fusion*         t-SN…\n6 PSP2   YML017W         Glucose   0.05      -0.69 biological process unk… mole…\n\ntail(ydat)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  symbol systematic_name nutrient  rate expression bp                      mf   \n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;chr&gt;\n1 DOA1   YKL213C         Uracil     0.3       0.14 ubiquitin-dependent pr… mole…\n2 KRE1   YNL322C         Uracil     0.3       0.28 cell wall organization… stru…\n3 MTL1   YGR023W         Uracil     0.3       0.27 cell wall organization… mole…\n4 KRE9   YJL174W         Uracil     0.3       0.43 cell wall organization… mole…\n5 UTH1   YKR042W         Uracil     0.3       0.19 mitochondrion organiza… mole…\n6 &lt;NA&gt;   YOL111C         Uracil     0.3       0.04 biological process unk… mole…\n\ndim(ydat)\n\n[1] 198430      7\n\nnames(ydat)\n\n[1] \"symbol\"          \"systematic_name\" \"nutrient\"        \"rate\"           \n[5] \"expression\"      \"bp\"              \"mf\"             \n\nstr(ydat)\n\nspc_tbl_ [198,430 × 7] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ symbol         : chr [1:198430] \"SFB2\" NA \"QRI7\" \"CFT2\" ...\n $ systematic_name: chr [1:198430] \"YNL049C\" \"YNL095C\" \"YDL104C\" \"YLR115W\" ...\n $ nutrient       : chr [1:198430] \"Glucose\" \"Glucose\" \"Glucose\" \"Glucose\" ...\n $ rate           : num [1:198430] 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 ...\n $ expression     : num [1:198430] -0.24 0.28 -0.02 -0.33 0.05 -0.69 -0.55 -0.75 -0.24 -0.16 ...\n $ bp             : chr [1:198430] \"ER to Golgi transport\" \"biological process unknown\" \"proteolysis and peptidolysis\" \"mRNA polyadenylylation*\" ...\n $ mf             : chr [1:198430] \"molecular function unknown\" \"molecular function unknown\" \"metalloendopeptidase activity\" \"RNA binding\" ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   symbol = col_character(),\n  ..   systematic_name = col_character(),\n  ..   nutrient = col_character(),\n  ..   rate = col_double(),\n  ..   expression = col_double(),\n  ..   bp = col_character(),\n  ..   mf = col_character()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\nsummary(ydat)\n\n    symbol          systematic_name      nutrient              rate      \n Length:198430      Length:198430      Length:198430      Min.   :0.050  \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:0.100  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :0.200  \n                                                          Mean   :0.175  \n                                                          3rd Qu.:0.250  \n                                                          Max.   :0.300  \n   expression         bp                 mf           \n Min.   :-6.50   Length:198430      Length:198430     \n 1st Qu.:-0.29   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median : 0.00   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   : 0.00                                        \n 3rd Qu.: 0.29                                        \n Max.   : 6.64                                        \n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Other packages\nThe glimpse() function is available once you load the dplyr library, and it’s like str() but its display is a little bit better.\n\nglimpse(ydat)\n\nRows: 198,430\nColumns: 7\n$ symbol          &lt;chr&gt; \"SFB2\", NA, \"QRI7\", \"CFT2\", \"SSO2\", \"PSP2\", \"RIB2\", \"V…\n$ systematic_name &lt;chr&gt; \"YNL049C\", \"YNL095C\", \"YDL104C\", \"YLR115W\", \"YMR183C\",…\n$ nutrient        &lt;chr&gt; \"Glucose\", \"Glucose\", \"Glucose\", \"Glucose\", \"Glucose\",…\n$ rate            &lt;dbl&gt; 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, …\n$ expression      &lt;dbl&gt; -0.24, 0.28, -0.02, -0.33, 0.05, -0.69, -0.55, -0.75, …\n$ bp              &lt;chr&gt; \"ER to Golgi transport\", \"biological process unknown\",…\n$ mf              &lt;chr&gt; \"molecular function unknown\", \"molecular function unkn…\n\n\nThe skimr package has a nice function, skim, that provides summary statistics the user can skim quickly to understand your data.

    "text": "3.1 Review\n\n3.1.1 Our data\nWe’re going to use the yeast gene expression dataset described on the data frames lesson in Chapter 2. This is a cleaned up version of a gene expression dataset from Brauer et al. Coordination of Growth Rate, Cell Cycle, Stress Response, and Metabolic Activity in Yeast (2008) Mol Biol Cell 19:352-367. This data is from a gene expression microarray, and in this paper the authors are examining the relationship between growth rate and gene expression in yeast cultures limited by one of six different nutrients (glucose, leucine, ammonium, sulfate, phosphate, uracil). If you give yeast a rich media loaded with nutrients except restrict the supply of a single nutrient, you can control the growth rate to any rate you choose. By starving yeast of specific nutrients you can find genes that:\n\nRaise or lower their expression in response to growth rate. Growth-rate dependent expression patterns can tell us a lot about cell cycle control, and how the cell responds to stress. The authors found that expression of &gt;25% of all yeast genes is linearly correlated with growth rate, independent of the limiting nutrient. They also found that the subset of negatively growth-correlated genes is enriched for peroxisomal functions, and positively correlated genes mainly encode ribosomal functions.\nRespond differently when different nutrients are being limited. If you see particular genes that respond very differently when a nutrient is sharply restricted, these genes might be involved in the transport or metabolism of that specific nutrient.\n\nYou can download the cleaned up version of the data here. The file is called brauer2007_tidy.csv. Later on we’ll actually start with the original raw data (minimally processed) and manipulate it so that we can make it more amenable for analysis.\n\n\n3.1.2 Reading in data\nWe need to load both the dplyr and readr packages for efficiently reading in and displaying this data. We’re also going to use many other functions from the dplyr package. Make sure you have these packages installed as described on the setup chapter (Appendix A).\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Read in data\nydat &lt;- read_csv(file=\"data/brauer2007_tidy.csv\")\n\n# Display the data\nydat\n\n# Optionally, bring up the data in a viewer window\n# View(ydat)\n\n# A tibble: 198,430 × 7\n   symbol systematic_name nutrient  rate expression bp                     mf   \n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 SFB2   YNL049C         Glucose   0.05      -0.24 ER to Golgi transport  mole…\n 2 &lt;NA&gt;   YNL095C         Glucose   0.05       0.28 biological process un… mole…\n 3 QRI7   YDL104C         Glucose   0.05      -0.02 proteolysis and pepti… meta…\n 4 CFT2   YLR115W         Glucose   0.05      -0.33 mRNA polyadenylylatio… RNA …\n 5 SSO2   YMR183C         Glucose   0.05       0.05 vesicle fusion*        t-SN…\n 6 PSP2   YML017W         Glucose   0.05      -0.69 biological process un… mole…\n 7 RIB2   YOL066C         Glucose   0.05      -0.55 riboflavin biosynthes… pseu…\n 8 VMA13  YPR036W         Glucose   0.05      -0.75 vacuolar acidification hydr…\n 9 EDC3   YEL015W         Glucose   0.05      -0.24 deadenylylation-indep… mole…\n10 VPS5   YOR069W         Glucose   0.05      -0.16 protein retention in … prot…\n# ℹ 198,420 more rows"

    "text": "3.2 The dplyr package\nThe dplyr package is a relatively new R package that makes data manipulation fast and easy. It imports functionality from another package called magrittr that allows you to chain commands together into a pipeline that will completely change the way you write R code such that you’re writing code the way you’re thinking about the problem.\nWhen you read in data with the readr package (read_csv()) and you had the dplyr package loaded already, the data frame takes on this “special” class of data frames called a tbl (pronounced “tibble”), which you can see with class(ydat). If you have other “regular” data frames in your workspace, the as_tibble() function will convert it into the special dplyr tbl that displays nicely (e.g.: iris &lt;- as_tibble(iris)). You don’t have to turn all your data frame objects into tibbles, but it does make working with large datasets a bit easier.\nYou can read more about tibbles in Tibbles chapter in R for Data Science or in the tibbles vignette. They keep most of the features of data frames, and drop the features that used to be convenient but are now frustrating (i.e. converting character vectors to factors). You can read more about the differences between data frames and tibbles in this section of the tibbles vignette, but the major convenience for us concerns printing (aka displaying) a tibble to the screen. When you print (i.e., display) a tibble, it only shows the first 10 rows and all the columns that fit on one screen. It also prints an abbreviated description of the column type. You can control the default appearance with options:\n\noptions(tibble.print_max = n, tibble.print_min = m): if there are more than n rows, print only the first m rows. Use options(tibble.print_max = Inf) to always show all rows.\noptions(tibble.width = Inf) will always print all columns, regardless of the width of the screen."

If you want to satisfy all of multiple conditions, you can use the “and” operator, &. The “or” operator | (the pipe character, usually shift-backslash) will return a subset that meet any of the conditions.\n\n\n==: Equal to\n!=: Not equal to\n&gt;, &gt;=: Greater than, greater than or equal to\n&lt;, &lt;=: Less than, less than or equal to\n\nLet’s try it out.

Don’t worry about what these commands are doing just yet - we’ll cover that later on when we talk about ggplot2. Here’s I’m taking the filtered dataset containing just expression estimates for LEU1 where I have 36 rows (one for each of 6 nutrients \\(\\times\\) 6 growth rates), and I’m piping that dataset to the plotting function, where I’m plotting rate on the x-axis, expression on the y-axis, mapping the value of nutrient to the color, and using a line plot to display the data.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nfilter(ydat, symbol==\"LEU1\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(rate, expression, colour=nutrient)) + geom_line(lwd=1.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook closely at that! LEU1 is highly expressed when starved of leucine because the cell has to synthesize its own! And as the amount of leucine in the environment (the growth rate) increases, the cell can worry less about synthesizing leucine, so LEU1 expression goes back down. Consequently the cell can devote more energy into other functions, and we see other genes’ expression very slightly raising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\n\nDisplay the data where the gene ontology biological process (the bp variable) is “leucine biosynthesis” (case-sensitive) and the limiting nutrient was Leucine. (Answer should return a 24-by-7 data frame – 4 genes \\(\\times\\) 6 growth rates).\nGene/rate combinations had high expression (in the top 1% of expressed genes)? Hint: see ?quantile and try quantile(ydat$expression, probs=.99) to see the expression value which is higher than 99% of all the data, then filter() based on that. Try wrapping your answer with a View() function so you can see the whole thing. What does it look like those genes are doing? Answer should return a 1971-by-7 data frame.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1.1 Aside: Writing Data to File\nWhat we’ve done up to this point is read in data from a file (read_csv(...)), and assigning that to an object in our workspace (ydat &lt;- ...). When we run operations like filter() on our data, consider two things:\n\nThe ydat object in our workspace is not being modified directly. That is, we can filter(ydat, ...), and a result is returned to the screen, but ydat remains the same. This effect is similar to what we demonstrated in our first session.\n\n\n# Assign the value '50' to the weight object.\nweight &lt;- 50\n\n# Print out weight to the screen (50)\nweight\n\n# What's the value of weight plus 10?\nweight + 10\n\n# Weight is still 50\nweight\n\n# Weight is only modified if we *reassign* weight to the modified value\nweight &lt;- weight+10\n# Weight is now 60\nweight\n\n\nMore importantly, the data file on disk (data/brauer2007_tidy.csv) is never modified. No matter what we do to ydat, the file is never modified. If we want to save the result of an operation to a file on disk, we can assign the result of an operation to an object, and write_csv that object to disk. See the help for ?write_csv (note, write_csv() with an underscore is part of the readr package – not to be confused with the built-in write.csv() function).\n\n\n# What's the result of this filter operation?\nfilter(ydat, nutrient==\"Leucine\" & bp==\"leucine biosynthesis\")\n\n# Assign the result to a new object\nleudat &lt;- filter(ydat, nutrient==\"Leucine\" & bp==\"leucine biosynthesis\")\n\n# Write that out to disk\nwrite_csv(leudat, \"leucinedata.csv\")\n\nNote that this is different than saving your entire workspace to an Rdata file, which would contain all the objects we’ve created (weight, ydat, leudat, etc).\n\n\n\n3.3.2 select()\nThe filter() function allows you to return only certain rows matching a condition. The select() function returns only certain columns. The first argument is the data, and subsequent arguments are the columns you want.\n\n# Select just the symbol and systematic_name\nselect(ydat, symbol, systematic_name)\n\n# A tibble: 198,430 × 2\n   symbol systematic_name\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;          \n 1 SFB2   YNL049C        \n 2 &lt;NA&gt;   YNL095C        \n 3 QRI7   YDL104C        \n 4 CFT2   YLR115W        \n 5 SSO2   YMR183C        \n 6 PSP2   YML017W        \n 7 RIB2   YOL066C        \n 8 VMA13  YPR036W        \n 9 EDC3   YEL015W        \n10 VPS5   YOR069W        \n# ℹ 198,420 more rows\n\n# Alternatively, just remove columns.

Notice again how the original data is unchanged.\n\n# create a new dataset without the go annotations.\nnogo &lt;- select(ydat, -bp, -mf)\nnogo\n\n# A tibble: 198,430 × 5\n   symbol systematic_name nutrient  rate expression\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 SFB2   YNL049C         Glucose   0.05      -0.24\n 2 &lt;NA&gt;   YNL095C         Glucose   0.05       0.28\n 3 QRI7   YDL104C         Glucose   0.05      -0.02\n 4 CFT2   YLR115W         Glucose   0.05      -0.33\n 5 SSO2   YMR183C         Glucose   0.05       0.05\n 6 PSP2   YML017W         Glucose   0.05      -0.69\n 7 RIB2   YOL066C         Glucose   0.05      -0.55\n 8 VMA13  YPR036W         Glucose   0.05      -0.75\n 9 EDC3   YEL015W         Glucose   0.05      -0.24\n10 VPS5   YOR069W         Glucose   0.05      -0.16\n# ℹ 198,420 more rows\n\n# we could filter this new dataset\nfilter(nogo, symbol==\"LEU1\" & rate==.05)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  symbol systematic_name nutrient   rate expression\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 LEU1   YGL009C         Glucose    0.05      -1.12\n2 LEU1   YGL009C         Ammonia    0.05      -0.76\n3 LEU1   YGL009C         Phosphate  0.05      -0.81\n4 LEU1   YGL009C         Sulfate    0.05      -1.57\n5 LEU1   YGL009C         Leucine    0.05       3.84\n6 LEU1   YGL009C         Uracil     0.05      -2.07\n\n# Notice how the original data is unchanged - still have all 7 columns\nydat\n\n# A tibble: 198,430 × 7\n   symbol systematic_name nutrient  rate expression bp                     mf   \n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 SFB2   YNL049C         Glucose   0.05      -0.24 ER to Golgi transport  mole…\n 2 &lt;NA&gt;   YNL095C         Glucose   0.05       0.28 biological process un… mole…\n 3 QRI7   YDL104C         Glucose   0.05      -0.02 proteolysis and pepti… meta…\n 4 CFT2   YLR115W         Glucose   0.05      -0.33 mRNA polyadenylylatio… RNA …\n 5 SSO2   YMR183C         Glucose   0.05       0.05 vesicle fusion*        t-SN…\n 6 PSP2   YML017W         Glucose   0.05      -0.69 biological process un… mole…\n 7 RIB2   YOL066C         Glucose   0.05      -0.55 riboflavin biosynthes… pseu…\n 8 VMA13  YPR036W         Glucose   0.05      -0.75 vacuolar acidification hydr…\n 9 EDC3   YEL015W         Glucose   0.05      -0.24 deadenylylation-indep… mole…\n10 VPS5   YOR069W         Glucose   0.05      -0.16 protein retention in … prot…\n# ℹ 198,420 more rows\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 mutate()\nThe mutate() function adds new columns to the data. Remember, it doesn’t actually modify the data frame you’re operating on, and the result is transient unless you assign it to a new object or reassign it back to itself (generally, not always a good practice).\nThe expression level reported here is the \\(log_2\\) of the sample signal divided by the signal in the reference channel, where the reference RNA for all samples was taken from the glucose-limited chemostat grown at a dilution rate of 0.25 \\(h^{-1}\\). Let’s mutate this data to add a new variable called “signal” that’s the actual raw signal ratio instead of the log-transformed signal.\n\nmutate(nogo, signal=2^expression)\n\nMutate has a nice little feature too in that it’s “lazy.” You can mutate and add one variable, then continue mutating to add more variables based on that variable. Let’s make another column that’s the square root of the signal ratio.\n\nmutate(nogo, signal=2^expression, sigsr=sqrt(signal))\n\n# A tibble: 198,430 × 7\n   symbol systematic_name nutrient  rate expression signal sigsr\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 SFB2   YNL049C         Glucose   0.05      -0.24  0.847 0.920\n 2 &lt;NA&gt;   YNL095C         Glucose   0.05       0.28  1.21  1.10 \n 3 QRI7   YDL104C         Glucose   0.05      -0.02  0.986 0.993\n 4 CFT2   YLR115W         Glucose   0.05      -0.33  0.796 0.892\n 5 SSO2   YMR183C         Glucose   0.05       0.05  1.04  1.02 \n 6 PSP2   YML017W         Glucose   0.05      -0.69  0.620 0.787\n 7 RIB2   YOL066C         Glucose   0.05      -0.55  0.683 0.826\n 8 VMA13  YPR036W         Glucose   0.05      -0.75  0.595 0.771\n 9 EDC3   YEL015W         Glucose   0.05      -0.24  0.847 0.920\n10 VPS5   YOR069W         Glucose   0.05      -0.16  0.895 0.946\n# ℹ 198,420 more rows\n\n\nAgain, don’t worry about the code here to make the plot – we’ll learn about this later.

It takes a data frame or tbl and arranges (or sorts) by column(s) of interest. The first argument is the data, and subsequent arguments are columns to sort on.

On its own the summarize() function doesn’t seem to be all that useful. The dplyr package provides a few convenience functions called n() and n_distinct() that tell you the number of observations or the number of distinct values of a particular variable.\nNotice that summarize takes a data frame and returns a data frame. In this case it’s a 1x1 data frame with a single row and a single column. The name of the column, by default is whatever the expression was used to summarize the data. This usually isn’t pretty, and if we wanted to work with this resulting data frame later on, we’d want to name that returned value something easier to deal with.\n\n# Get the mean expression for all genes\nsummarize(ydat, mean(expression))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `mean(expression)`\n               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1            0.00337\n\n# Use a more friendly name, e.g., meanexp, or whatever you want to call it.\nsummarize(ydat, meanexp=mean(expression))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  meanexp\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.00337\n\n# Measure the correlation between rate and expression \nsummarize(ydat, r=cor(rate, expression))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n        r\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.0220\n\n# Get the number of observations\nsummarize(ydat, n())\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n   `n()`\n   &lt;int&gt;\n1 198430\n\n# The number of distinct gene symbols in the data \nsummarize(ydat, n_distinct(symbol))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `n_distinct(symbol)`\n                 &lt;int&gt;\n1                 4211\n\n\n\n\n3.3.6 group_by()\nWe saw that summarize() isn’t that useful on its own.

The dplyr package imports functionality from the magrittr package that lets you pipe the output of one function to the input of another, so you can avoid nesting functions. It looks like this: |&gt;. You don’t have to load the magrittr package to use it since dplyr imports its functionality when you load the dplyr package.\nHere’s the simplest way to use it. Remember the tail() function. It expects a data frame as input, and the next argument is the number of lines to print. These two commands are identical:\n\ntail(ydat, 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 7\n  symbol systematic_name nutrient  rate expression bp                      mf   \n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;chr&gt;\n1 KRE1   YNL322C         Uracil     0.3       0.28 cell wall organization… stru…\n2 MTL1   YGR023W         Uracil     0.3       0.27 cell wall organization… mole…\n3 KRE9   YJL174W         Uracil     0.3       0.43 cell wall organization… mole…\n4 UTH1   YKR042W         Uracil     0.3       0.19 mitochondrion organiza… mole…\n5 &lt;NA&gt;   YOL111C         Uracil     0.3       0.04 biological process unk… mole…\n\nydat |&gt; tail(5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 7\n  symbol systematic_name nutrient  rate expression bp                      mf   \n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;chr&gt;\n1 KRE1   YNL322C         Uracil     0.3       0.28 cell wall organization… stru…\n2 MTL1   YGR023W         Uracil     0.3       0.27 cell wall organization… mole…\n3 KRE9   YJL174W         Uracil     0.3       0.43 cell wall organization… mole…\n4 UTH1   YKR042W         Uracil     0.3       0.19 mitochondrion organiza… mole…\n5 &lt;NA&gt;   YOL111C         Uracil     0.3       0.04 biological process unk… mole…\n\n\nLet’s use one of the dplyr verbs.\n\nfilter(ydat, nutrient==\"Leucine\")\n\n# A tibble: 33,178 × 7\n   symbol systematic_name nutrient  rate expression bp                     mf   \n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 SFB2   YNL049C         Leucine   0.05       0.18 ER to Golgi transport  mole…\n 2 &lt;NA&gt;   YNL095C         Leucine   0.05       0.16 biological process un… mole…\n 3 QRI7   YDL104C         Leucine   0.05      -0.3  proteolysis and pepti… meta…\n 4 CFT2   YLR115W         Leucine   0.05      -0.27 mRNA polyadenylylatio… RNA …\n 5 SSO2   YMR183C         Leucine   0.05      -0.59 vesicle fusion*        t-SN…\n 6 PSP2   YML017W         Leucine   0.05      -0.17 biological process un… mole…\n 7 RIB2   YOL066C         Leucine   0.05      -0.02 riboflavin biosynthes… pseu…\n 8 VMA13  YPR036W         Leucine   0.05      -0.11 vacuolar acidification hydr…\n 9 EDC3   YEL015W         Leucine   0.05       0.12 deadenylylation-indep… mole…\n10 VPS5   YOR069W         Leucine   0.05      -0.2  protein retention in … prot…\n# ℹ 33,168 more rows\n\nydat |&gt; filter(nutrient==\"Leucine\")\n\n# A tibble: 33,178 × 7\n   symbol systematic_name nutrient  rate expression bp                     mf   \n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 SFB2   YNL049C         Leucine   0.05       0.18 ER to Golgi transport  mole…\n 2 &lt;NA&gt;   YNL095C         Leucine   0.05       0.16 biological process un… mole…\n 3 QRI7   YDL104C         Leucine   0.05      -0.3  proteolysis and pepti… meta…\n 4 CFT2   YLR115W         Leucine   0.05      -0.27 mRNA polyadenylylatio… RNA …\n 5 SSO2   YMR183C         Leucine   0.05      -0.59 vesicle fusion*        t-SN…\n 6 PSP2   YML017W         Leucine   0.05      -0.17 biological process un… mole…\n 7 RIB2   YOL066C         Leucine   0.05      -0.02 riboflavin biosynthes… pseu…\n 8 VMA13  YPR036W         Leucine   0.05      -0.11 vacuolar acidification hydr…\n 9 EDC3   YEL015W         Leucine   0.05       0.12 deadenylylation-indep… mole…\n10 VPS5   YOR069W         Leucine   0.05      -0.2  protein retention in … prot…\n# ℹ 33,168 more rows\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Nesting versus |&gt;\nSo what?\nNow, think about this for a minute. What if we wanted to get the correlation between the growth rate and expression separately for each limiting nutrient only for genes in the leucine biosynthesis pathway, and return a sorted list of those correlation coeffients rounded to two digits? Mentally we would do something like this:\n\nTake the ydat dataset\nthen filter() it for genes in the leucine biosynthesis pathway\nthen group_by() the limiting nutrient\nthen summarize() to get the correlation (cor()) between rate and expression\nthen mutate() to round the result of the above calculation to two significant digits\nthen arrange() by the rounded correlation coefficient above\n\nBut in code, it gets ugly. First, take the ydat dataset\n\nydat\n\nthen filter() it for genes in the leucine biosynthesis pathway\n\nfilter(ydat, bp==\"leucine biosynthesis\")\n\nthen group_by() the limiting nutrient\n\ngroup_by(filter(ydat, bp==\"leucine biosynthesis\"), nutrient)\n\nthen summarize() to get the correlation (cor()) between rate and expression\n\nsummarize(group_by(filter(ydat, bp == \"leucine biosynthesis\"), nutrient), r = cor(rate,\n    expression))\n\nthen mutate() to round the result of the above calculation to two significant digits\n\nmutate(summarize(group_by(filter(ydat, bp == \"leucine biosynthesis\"), nutrient),\n    r = cor(rate, expression)), r = round(r, 2))\n\nthen arrange() by the rounded correlation coefficient above\n\narrange(\n  mutate(\n    summarize(\n      group_by(\n        filter(ydat, bp==\"leucine biosynthesis\"), \n      nutrient), \n    r=cor(rate, expression)), \n  r=round(r, 2)), \nr)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  nutrient      r\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Leucine   -0.58\n2 Glucose   -0.04\n3 Ammonia    0.16\n4 Sulfate    0.33\n5 Phosphate  0.44\n6 Uracil     0.58\n\n\nNow compare that with the mental process of what you’re actually trying to accomplish. The way you would do this without pipes is completely inside-out and backwards from the way you express in words and in thought what you want to do. The pipe operator |&gt; allows you to pass the output data frame from one function to the input data frame to another function.\n\n\n\nNesting functions versus piping\n\n\nThis is how we would do that in code. It’s as simple as replacing the word “then” in words to the symbol |&gt; in code. (There’s a keyboard shortcut that I’ll use frequently to insert the |&gt; sequence – you can see what it is by clicking the Tools menu in RStudio, then selecting Keyboard Shortcut Help.

Now if you try to use the old syntax, you’ll get a deprecation warning.\n\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 3\n# Groups:   nutrient [6]\n   nutrient  bp                                            meanexp\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                                           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Ammonia   allantoate transport                             6.64\n 2 Ammonia   amino acid transport*                            6.64\n 3 Phosphate glycerophosphodiester transport                  6.64\n 4 Glucose   fermentation*                                    6.28\n 5 Ammonia   allantoin transport                              5.56\n 6 Glucose   glyoxylate cycle                                 5.28\n 7 Glucose   oxygen and reactive oxygen species metabolism    5.04\n 8 Uracil    fumarate transport*                              4.32\n 9 Phosphate vacuole fusion, non-autophagic                   4.20\n10 Leucine   fermentation*                                    4.15\n11 Phosphate regulation of cell redox homeostasis*            4.03\n12 Leucine   fumarate transport*                              3.72\n13 Leucine   glyoxylate cycle                                 3.65\n14 Sulfate   protein ubiquitination                           3.4 \n15 Sulfate   fumarate transport*                              3.27\n16 Uracil    pyridoxine metabolism                            3.11\n17 Uracil    asparagine catabolism*                           3.06\n18 Sulfate   sulfur amino acid metabolism*                    2.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12\n\n\n\nThere’s a slight problem with the examples above.

On their own they don’t do anything that base R can’t do. Here are some of the single-table verbs we’ll be working with in this lesson (single-table meaning that they only work on a single table – contrast that to two-table verbs used for joining data together). They all take a data.frame or tbl as their input for the first argument, and they all return a data.frame or tbl as output.\n\nfilter(): filters rows of the data where some condition is true\nselect(): selects out particular columns of interest\nmutate(): adds new columns or changes values of existing columns\narrange(): arranges a data frame by the value of a column\nsummarize(): summarizes multiple values to a single value, most useful when combined with…\ngroup_by(): groups a data frame by one or more variable. Most data operations are useful done on groups defined by variables in the the dataset. The group_by function takes an existing data frame and converts it into a grouped data frame where summarize() operations are performed by group.\n\nAdditionally, the |&gt; operator allows you to “chain” operations together. Rather than nesting functions inside out, the |&gt; operator allows you to write operations left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Let’s say we wanted to get the average life expectancy and GDP (not GDP per capita) for Asian countries for each year.\n\nThe |&gt; would allow us to do this:\n\ngm |&gt;\n  mutate(gdp=gdpPercap*pop) |&gt;\n  filter(continent==\"Asia\") |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  summarize(mean(lifeExp), mean(gdp))\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 3\n    year `mean(lifeExp)`   `mean(gdp)`\n   &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1952            46.3  34095762661.\n 2  1957            49.3  47267432088.\n 3  1962            51.6  60136869012.\n 4  1967            54.7  84648519224.\n 5  1972            57.3 124385747313.\n 6  1977            59.6 159802590186.\n 7  1982            62.6 194429049919.\n 8  1987            64.9 241784763369.\n 9  1992            66.5 307100497486.\n10  1997            68.0 387597655323.\n11  2002            69.2 458042336179.\n12  2007            70.7 627513635079.\n\n\nInstead of this:\n\nsummarize(\n  group_by(\n    filter(\n      mutate(gm, gdp=gdpPercap*pop), \n    continent==\"Asia\"), \n  year), \nmean(lifeExp), mean(gdp))"

    "section": "4.2 About ggplot2",
    "text": "4.2 About ggplot2\nggplot2 is a widely used R package that extends R’s visualization capabilities. It takes the hassle out of things like creating legends, mapping other variables to scales like color, or faceting plots into small multiples. We’ll learn about what all these things mean shortly.\nWhere does the “gg” in ggplot2 come from? The ggplot2 package provides an R implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics (1999). The Grammar of Graphics allows you to think beyond the garden variety plot types (e.g. scatterplot, barplot) and the consider the components that make up a plot or graphic, such as how data are represented on the plot (as lines, points, etc.), how variables are mapped to coordinates or plotting shape or color, what transformation or statistical summary is required, and so on.\nSpecifically, ggplot2 allows you to build a plot layer-by-layer by specifying:\n\na geom, which specifies how the data are represented on the plot (points, lines, bars, etc.),\naesthetics that map variables in the data to axes on the plot or to plotting size, shape, color, etc.,\na stat, a statistical transformation or summary of the data applied prior to plotting,\nfacets, which we’ve already seen above, that allow the data to be divided into chunks on the basis of other categorical or continuous variables and the same plot drawn for each chunk.\n\nFirst, a note about qplot(). The qplot() function is a quick and dirty way of making ggplot2 plots. You might see it if you look for help with ggplot2, and it’s even covered extensively in the ggplot2 book. And if you’re used to making plots with built-in base graphics, the qplot() function will probably feel more familiar. But the sooner you abandon the qplot() syntax the sooner you’ll start to really understand ggplot2’s approach to building up plots layer by layer. So we’re not going to use it at all in this class."

    "section": "4.3 Plotting bivariate data: continuous Y by continuous X",
    "text": "4.3 Plotting bivariate data: continuous Y by continuous X\nThe ggplot function has two required arguments: the data used for creating the plot, and an aesthetic mapping to describe how variables in said data are mapped to things we can see on the plot.\nFirst let’s load the package:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nNow, let’s lay out the plot. If we want to plot a continuous Y variable by a continuous X variable we’re probably most interested in a scatter plot. Here, we’re telling ggplot that we want to use the gm dataset, and the aesthetic mapping will map gdpPercap onto the x-axis and lifeExp onto the y-axis. Remember that the variable names are case sensitive!\n\nggplot(gm, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))\n\n\n\n\nWhen we do that we get a blank canvas with no data showing (you might get an error if you’re using an old version of ggplot2). That’s because all we’ve done is laid out a two-dimensional plot specifying what goes on the x and y axes, but we haven’t told it what kind of geometric object to plot. The obvious choice here is a point. Check out docs.ggplot2.org to see what kind of geoms are available.\n\nggplot(gm, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nHere, we’ve built our plot in layers. First, we create a canvas for plotting layers to come using the ggplot function, specifying which data to use (here, the gm data frame), and an aesthetic mapping of gdpPercap to the x-axis and lifeExp to the y-axis. We next add a layer to the plot, specifying a geom, or a way of visually representing the aesthetic mapping.\nNow, the typical workflow for building up a ggplot2 plot is to first construct the figure and save that to a variable (for example, p), and as you’re experimenting, you can continue to re-define the p object as you develop “keeper commands”.\nFirst, let’s construct the graphic. Notice that we don’t have to specify x= and y= if we specify the arguments in the correct order (x is first, y is second).\n\np &lt;- ggplot(gm, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp))\n\nThe p object now contains the canvas, but nothing else. Try displaying it by just running p. Let’s experiment with adding points and a different scale to the x-axis.\n\n# Experiment with adding poings\np + geom_point()\n\n\n\n# Experiment with a different scale\np + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()\n\n\n\n\nI like the look of using a log scale for the x-axis. Let’s make that stick.\n\np &lt;- p + scale_x_log10()\n\nNow, if we re-ran p still nothing would show up because the p object just contains a blank canvas. Now, re-plot again with a layer of points:\n\np + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nNow notice what I’ve saved to p at this point: only the basic plot layout and the log10 mapping on the x-axis. I didn’t save any layers yet because I want to fiddle around with the points for a bit first.\nAbove we implied the aesthetic mappings for the x- and y- axis should be gdpPercap and lifeExp, but we can also add aesthetic mappings to the geoms themselves. For instance, what if we wanted to color the points by the value of another variable in the dataset, say, continent?\n\np + geom_point(aes(color=continent))\n\n\n\n\nNotice the difference here. If I wanted the colors to be some static value, I wouldn’t wrap that in a call to aes(). I would just specify it outright. Same thing with other features of the points. For example, lets make all the points huge (size=8) blue (color=\"blue\") semitransparent (alpha=(1/4)) triangles (pch=17):\n\np + geom_point(color=\"blue\", pch=17, size=8, alpha=1/4)\n\n\n\n\nNow, this time, let’s map the aesthetics of the point character to certain features of the data. For instance, let’s give the points different colors and character shapes according to the continent, and map the size of the point onto the life Expectancy:\n\np + geom_point(aes(col=continent, shape=continent, size=lifeExp))\n\n\n\n\nNow, this isn’t a great plot because there are several aesthetic mappings that are redundant. Life expectancy is mapped to both the y-axis and the size of the points – the size mapping is superfluous. Similarly, continent is mapped to both the color and the point character (the shape is superfluous). Let’s get rid of that, but let’s make the points a little bigger outsize of an aesthetic mapping.\n\np + geom_point(aes(col=continent), size=3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nRe-create this same plot from scratch without saving anything to a variable. That is, start from the ggplot call.\n\nStart with the ggplot() function.\nUse the gm data.\nMap gdpPercap to the x-axis and lifeExp to the y-axis.\nAdd points to the plot\n\nMake the points size 3\nMap continent onto the aesthetics of the point\n\nUse a log10 scale for the x-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1 Adding layers\nLet’s add a fitted curve to the points. Recreate the plot in the p object if you need to.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(gm, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) + scale_x_log10()\np + geom_point() + geom_smooth()\n\n\n\n\nBy default geom_smooth() will try to lowess for data with n&lt;1000 or generalized additive models for data with n&gt;1000. We can change that behavior by tweaking the parameters to use a thick red line, use a linear model instead of a GAM, and to turn off the standard error stripes.\n\np + geom_point() + geom_smooth(lwd=2, se=FALSE, method=\"lm\", col=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\nBut let’s add back in our aesthetic mapping to the continents. Notice what happens here. We’re mapping continent as an aesthetic mapping to the color of the points only – so geom_smooth() still works only on the entire data.\n\np + geom_point(aes(color = continent)) + geom_smooth()\n\n\n\n\nBut notice what happens here: we make the call to aes() outside of the geom_point() call, and the continent variable gets mapped as an aesthetic to any further geoms. So here, we get separate smoothing lines for each continent. Let’s do it again but remove the standard error stripes and make the lines a bit thicker.\n\np + aes(color = continent) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()\np + aes(color = continent) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=F, lwd=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Faceting\nFacets display subsets of the data in different panels. There are a couple ways to do this, but facet_wrap() tries to sensibly wrap a series of facets into a 2-dimensional grid of small multiples. Just give it a formula specifying which variables to facet by. We can continue adding more layers, such as smoothing. If you have a look at the help for ?facet_wrap() you’ll see that we can control how the wrapping is laid out.\n\np + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~continent)\np + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + facet_wrap(~continent, ncol=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Saving plots\nThere are a few ways to save ggplots. The quickest way, that works in an interactive session, is to use the ggsave() function. You give it a file name and by default it saves the last plot that was printed to the screen.\n\np + geom_point()\nggsave(file=\"myplot.png\")\n\nBut if you’re running this through a script, the best way to do it is to pass ggsave() the object containing the plot that is meant to be saved. We can also adjust things like the width, height, and resolution. ggsave() also recognizes the name of the file extension and saves the appropriate kind of file. Let’s save a PDF.\n\npfinal &lt;- p + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + facet_wrap(~continent, ncol=1)\nggsave(pfinal, file=\"myplot.pdf\", width=5, height=15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\n\nMake a scatter plot of lifeExp on the y-axis against year on the x.\nMake a series of small multiples faceting on continent.\nAdd a fitted curve, smooth or lm, with and without facets.\nBonus: using geom_line() and and aesthetic mapping country to group=, make a “spaghetti plot”, showing semitransparent lines connected for each country, faceted by continent. Add a smoothed loess curve with a thick (lwd=3) line with no standard error stripe. Reduce the opacity (alpha=) of the individual black lines. Don’t show Oceania countries (that is, filter() the data where continent!=\"Oceania\" before you plot it)."

    "text": "4.4 Plotting bivariate data: continuous Y by categorical X\nWith the last example we examined the relationship between a continuous Y variable against a continuous X variable. A scatter plot was the obvious kind of data visualization. But what if we wanted to visualize a continuous Y variable against a categorical X variable? We sort of saw what that looked like in the last exercise. year is a continuous variable, but in this dataset, it’s broken up into 5-year segments, so you could almost think of each year as a categorical variable. But a better example would be life expectancy against continent or country.\nFirst, let’s set up the basic plot:\n\np &lt;- ggplot(gm, aes(continent, lifeExp)) \n\nThen add points:\n\np + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nThat’s not terribly useful. There’s a big overplotting problem. We can try to solve with transparency:\n\np + geom_point(alpha=1/4)\n\n\n\n\nBut that really only gets us so far. What if we spread things out by adding a little bit of horizontal noise (aka “jitter”) to the data.\n\np + geom_jitter()\n\n\n\n\nNote that the little bit of horizontal noise that’s added to the jitter is random. If you run that command over and over again, each time it will look slightly different. The idea is to visualize the density at each vertical position, and spreading out the points horizontally allows you to do that. If there were still lots of over-plotting you might think about adding some transparency by setting the alpha= value for the jitter.\n\np + geom_jitter(alpha=1/2)\n\n\n\n\nProbably a more common visualization is to show a box plot:\n\np + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nBut why not show the summary and the raw data?\n\np + geom_jitter() + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nNotice how in that example we first added the jitter layer then added the boxplot layer. But the boxplot is now superimposed over the jitter layer. Let’s make the jitter layer go on top. Also, go back to just the boxplots. Notice that the outliers are represented as points. But there’s no distinction between the outlier point from the boxplot geom and all the other points from the jitter geom. Let’s change that. Notice the British spelling.\n\np + geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = \"red\") + geom_jitter(alpha=1/2)\n\n\n\n\nThere’s another geom that’s useful here, called a voilin plot.\n\np + geom_violin()\n\n\n\np + geom_violin() + geom_jitter(alpha=1/2)\n\n\n\n\nLet’s go back to our boxplot for a moment.\n\np + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nThis plot would be a lot more effective if the continents were shown in some sort of order other than alphabetical. To do that, we’ll have to go back to our basic build of the plot again and use the reorder function in our original aesthetic mapping. Here, reorder is taking the first variable, which is some categorical variable, and ordering it by the level of the mean of the second variable, which is a continuous variable. It looks like this\n\np &lt;- ggplot(gm, aes(x=reorder(continent, lifeExp), y=lifeExp))\n\n\np + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n\n\n\nMake a jittered strip plot of GDP per capita against continent.\nMake a box plot of GDP per capita against continent.\nUsing a log10 y-axis scale, overlay semitransparent jittered points on top of box plots, where outlying points are colored.\nBONUS: Try to reorder the continents on the x-axis by GDP per capita. Why isn’t this working as expected? See ?reorder for clues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  continent `mean(gdpPercap)`\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Africa                2194.\n2 Americas              7136.\n3 Asia                  7902.\n4 Europe               14469.\n5 Oceania              18622.\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  continent `mean(log10(gdpPercap))`\n  &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Africa                        3.15\n2 Americas                      3.74\n3 Asia                          3.51\n4 Europe                        4.06\n5 Oceania                       4.25"

    "text": "4.5 Plotting univariate continuous data\nWhat if we just wanted to visualize distribution of a single continuous variable? A histogram is the usual go-to visualization. Here we only have one aesthetic mapping instead of two.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(gm, aes(lifeExp))\n\n\np + geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\nWhen we do this ggplot lets us know that we’re automatically selecting the width of the bins, and we might want to think about this a little further.\n\np + geom_histogram(bins=30)\n\n\n\np + geom_histogram(bins=10)\n\n\n\np + geom_histogram(bins=200)\n\n\n\n\n\np + geom_histogram(bins=60)\n\n\n\n\nAlternative we could plot a smoothed density curve instead of a histogram:\n\np + geom_density()\n\n\n\n\nBack to histograms. What if we wanted to color this by continent?\n\np + geom_histogram(aes(color=continent))\n\n\n\n\nThat’s not what we had in mind. That’s just the outline of the bars. We want to change the fill color of the bars.\n\np + geom_histogram(aes(fill=continent))\n\n\n\n\nWell, that’s not exactly what we want either. If you look at the help for ?geom_histogram you’ll see that by default it stacks overlapping points. This isn’t really an effective visualization. Let’s change the position argument.\n\np + geom_histogram(aes(fill=continent), position=\"identity\")\n\n\n\n\nBut the problem there is that the histograms are blocking each other. What if we tried transparency?\n\np + geom_histogram(aes(fill=continent), position=\"identity\", alpha=1/3)\n\n\n\n\nThat’s somewhat helpful, and might work for two distributions, but it gets cumbersome with 5. Let’s go back and try this with density plots, first changing the color of the line:\n\np + geom_density(aes(color=continent))\n\n\n\n\nThen by changing the color of the fill and setting the transparency to 25%:\n\np + geom_density(aes(fill=continent), alpha=1/4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\n\n\n\n\nPlot a histogram of GDP Per Capita.\nDo the same but use a log10 x-axis.\nStill on the log10 x-axis scale, try a density plot mapping continent to the fill of each density distribution, and reduce the opacity.\nStill on the log10 x-axis scale, make a histogram faceted by continent and filled by continent. Facet with a single column (see ?facet_wrap for help).\nSave this figure to a 6x10 PDF file."
